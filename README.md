## Objectives

I wanted to create a fitness application unlike any other fitness app. All the
applications I have encountered have put the focus on losing weight and counting
caleries. I wanted to create one where the focus is on the enjoyment of the
activity. Play-Log does that. Play log will be an application which allows a user
to create one or many profiles. Each profile will be able to story exercises.
An exercise can be any activity from going to the gym, swimming, hiking,
or even aerials or acrobatics

2.  Follow the instructions here for how to work with an ember application:
